# This is a simple Podman setup script for the DAVMail service

This script will initialize a podman pod with required containers to run your own
instance of the [DAVMail](https://github.com/mguessan/davmail) service.  

This container is fairly "ready-to-go" - no real configuration needed unless you wish to change options.
You will need to configure your own Reverse Proxy service and TLS certificates.  

## Help!
If you need any help with getting this running, please raise an issue and I'll do my best to assist
